ü§ñ AnomalyGuard
===============

This is a **Clarity smart contract** designed for **AI-Powered Transaction Anomaly Detection**. It simulates the behavior of an AI analysis engine by implementing a multi-factor, threshold-based risk scoring system to monitor user transaction patterns and flag suspicious activities in real-time. This contract is intended to be integrated into a larger DeFi or financial application to provide an initial, on-chain layer of security and compliance monitoring.

* * * * *

üåü Features
-----------

-   **Multi-Factor Risk Scoring:** Calculates a weighted risk score (0-100) based on three primary anomaly indicators:

    -   **Velocity Anomaly:** High frequency of transactions within a recent block window.

    -   **Amount Anomaly:** Significant deviation from the account's historical average transaction amount.

    -   **Frequency Anomaly:** Transactions occurring very rapidly (e.g., within 1 block of the last one).

-   **Threshold-Based Detection:** Flags a transaction as an anomaly if the calculated risk score exceeds a configurable `risk-score-threshold`.

-   **Historical Tracking:** Maintains on-chain statistics for each monitored account, including `total-transactions`, `total-volume`, and `average-amount`.

-   **Severity Levels:** Assigns a severity level (Low, Medium, High, Critical) to recorded anomalies based on the final risk score.

-   **Account Freezing:** Allows the contract owner to manually freeze and unfreeze accounts flagged as suspicious, preventing further activity via the contract.

-   **Configurable Parameters:** Allows the contract owner to dynamically adjust the core detection thresholds (`velocity-threshold`, `amount-deviation-threshold`, `risk-score-threshold`) to fine-tune the system's sensitivity.

-   **Audit Trail:** Stores detailed records of all detected anomalies for compliance and manual review.

üèóÔ∏è Contract Structure
----------------------

The contract is written in **Clarity**, a decidable language for smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

### Data Storage

| **Map/Variable** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `account-stats` (Map) | `principal` $\to$ `{...}` | Stores comprehensive historical and current statistics for each account. |
| `anomaly-records` (Map) | `{account: principal, transaction-id: uint}` $\to$ `{...}` | Detailed record of every detected anomalous transaction. |
| `velocity-threshold` (Var) | `uint` | Max transactions allowed in the detection window before triggering a velocity anomaly. |
| `amount-deviation-threshold` (Var) | `uint` | Percentage deviation from average transaction amount to trigger an anomaly. |
| `risk-score-threshold` (Var) | `uint` | Minimum combined risk score (0-100) to flag a transaction as an anomaly. |
| `detection-window` (Var) | `uint` | Number of blocks to analyze for transaction velocity. |
| `transaction-counter` (Var) | `uint` | A global counter used to generate unique IDs for anomaly records. |

* * * * *

üöÄ Public Functions (Main Interface)
------------------------------------

These are the functions that alter the contract's state or perform the core logic.

| **Function** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `(analyze-transaction (account principal) (amount uint))` | Public | **CORE LOGIC.** Analyzes a new transaction, calculates the risk score, records any anomaly, updates account stats, and asserts that the account is not frozen. |
| `(update-thresholds (new-velocity uint) (new-deviation uint) (new-risk uint))` | Public (Owner-Only) | Sets the core detection parameters for velocity, amount deviation, and the overall risk score threshold. |
| `(set-account-freeze (account principal) (freeze bool))` | Public (Owner-Only) | Manually **freezes or unfreezes** a suspicious account based on owner discretion. |
| `(resolve-anomaly (account principal) (tx-id uint))` | Public (Owner-Only) | Marks a previously recorded anomaly in `anomaly-records` as resolved for audit purposes. |

* * * * *

üîé Read-Only Functions (Inspection)
-----------------------------------

These functions do not alter the contract's state and are used for external monitoring, auditing, and retrieving account data.

| **Function** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `(get-account-stats (account principal))` | Read-Only | Retrieves the latest statistics for a given account, including total transactions, average amount, and current risk score. Returns default stats if the account is new. |
| `(get-anomaly-record (account principal) (tx-id uint))` | Read-Only | Retrieves a specific anomaly record by the account and the unique transaction ID. |
| `(get-velocity-threshold)` | Read-Only (Implied from code structure) | Returns the current value of the `velocity-threshold` data variable. |
| `(get-risk-score-threshold)` | Read-Only (Implied from code structure) | Returns the current value of the `risk-score-threshold` data variable. |
| `(get-total-anomalies-detected)` | Read-Only (Implied from code structure) | Returns the total count of anomalies recorded since contract deployment. |

üõ†Ô∏è Usage and Integration
-------------------------

The primary integration point is the `analyze-transaction` function. Any financial contract (e.g., a token transfer, swap, or loan execution) should call this function **before** completing the transaction.

### Example Integration Flow

1.  User initiates a financial transaction (e.g., `(ft-transfer u100)`).

2.  The financial contract internally calls `(contract-name.analyze-transaction tx-sender u100)`.

3.  `analyze-transaction` performs checks:

    -   **If the account is frozen:** The function will `asserts!` and return `err-account-frozen`, blocking the financial transaction.

    -   **If an anomaly is detected:**

        -   The transaction completes successfully (it is not blocked by default, only flagged for review).

        -   A detailed record is added to `anomaly-records`.

        -   The function returns the anomaly details (risk score, severity).

    -   **If no anomaly is detected:**

        -   The transaction completes successfully.

        -   The function returns the analysis data.

4.  The financial contract then proceeds with the fund transfer or asset interaction.

### Anomaly Score Calculation Detail

The `calculate-risk-score` private function implements the following weighted average:

$$\text{Risk Score} = 0.40 \times \text{Velocity Score} + 0.40 \times \text{Amount Score} + 0.20 \times \text{Frequency Score}$$

| **Factor** | **Weight** | **Score Logic Summary** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Velocity** | 40% | Measures transaction rate in the `detection-window`. Score increases if rate exceeds `velocity-threshold`. |
| **Amount** | 40% | Measures the percentage deviation from the account's historical average amount. |
| **Frequency** | 20% | A high score is assigned for extremely rapid, back-to-back transactions (within 2 blocks). |

üõ°Ô∏è Error Codes
---------------

| **Error Code** | **Constant** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `u100` | `err-owner-only` | The function can only be called by the contract owner. |
| `u101` | `err-invalid-amount` | The transaction amount must be greater than zero. |
| `u102` | `err-account-frozen` | The transaction is blocked because the account has been manually frozen. |
| `u104` | `err-invalid-parameters` | One or more input parameters are invalid. |
| `u105` | `err-not-found` | Could not find the requested account stats or anomaly record. |
